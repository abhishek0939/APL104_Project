Material Characterization in 2D elastic plate [Sept. 2024 - Nov. 2024]
Under Prof. Rajdip Nayek
– Determined Lame’s constants of a 2D plate using SciPy, with 100% accuracy under given equilibrium conditions.
– Modeled displacements using cubic fitting and calculated stress-strain distribution over a 100×100 mesh grid.
