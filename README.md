# Material Characterization in 2D elastic plate 
Under Prof. Rajdip Nayek
## 
- Determined Lame’s constants of a 2D plate using SciPy, with 100% accuracy under given equilibrium conditions.
- Modeled displacements using cubic fitting and calculated stress-strain distribution over a 100×100 mesh grid.
